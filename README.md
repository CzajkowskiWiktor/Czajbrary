# Czajbrary

Welcome to my page - Czajbrary.
It's a page about my books collection which I have been collecting for few years. The purpose of the page was to improve my web skills.
I followed the course on Udemy and implemented my functions and more.
Built using modern technologies: Node.js, express, mongoDB, mongoose, stripe and much more.
There is a room for improvment to import new things and functions to the page.
You are able to sign up and sign in. If you are logged in, you can rent a book, add review, see your rented books and added reviews. You can also change your account setting, including changing profile picture and changing password. As a admin you can also add a new Book to collection.
